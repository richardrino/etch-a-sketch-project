# etch-a-sketch-project

This is small web app that allows you to draw on a grid area similar to the etch-a-sketch tablets you may have had as a kid! Just click and drag your mouse over the grid area and it will fill in with color. There's a reset button to clear your drawing and a button that will prompt you to enter a number that will be used to change the number of grid squares without affecting the size of the grid itself.

This project served primarily as a refresher of concepts I had learned and to practice my JavaScript skills.

Some of the skills I was able to utilize in this project include:

- Flexbox
- DOM manipulation
- Class creation
